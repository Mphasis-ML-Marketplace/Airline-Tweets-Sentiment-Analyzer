Thank you glad to be home. There were lots of delays with the plane and flight crew didn't show up. It was very frustrating.
is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
"yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around."
OK I will call them likely tmrw UK time to question the process getting the change charge reversed due to a bereavement
no thanks
